BLOCKCHAIN SHIT: SO MANDA UMA INSTACIA DESSE CARALHO POHA QUAL DIFICULDADE VIADO

    match_data = {
        "player1": match_result.player1,
        "player2": match_result.player2,

    The two lines of code serve different purposes:

contract = w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)

Purpose: Creates an instance of the smart contract on the blockchain.
Explanation:
w3.eth.contract: This part creates a contract object that allows you to interact with the smart contract.
address: This is the unique address of your deployed smart contract on the blockchain.
abi: This is the Application Binary Interface (ABI) of your smart contract, which defines the functions, events, and data structures.
In essence: This line connects your code to the specific smart contract on the blockchain, providing a way to interact with its functions.
tx_hash = contract.functions.storeMatchResult(match_data).call()

Purpose: Calls a function in the smart contract and stores the transaction hash.
Explanation:
contract.functions.storeMatchResult: This part accesses the storeMatchResult function defined in your smart contract.
match_data: This is the data you want to pass to the function.
.call(): This part executes the function and returns the transaction hash.
In essence: This line sends the match_data to the storeMatchResult function in your smart contract, initiating a transaction on the blockchain. The transaction hash is returned as a result.
